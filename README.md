The Proteome of Dictyostelium discoideum Across Its Entire Life Cycle Reveals Sharp Transitions Between Developmental Stages
Downstream analysis of the Dictyostelium discoideum complete life cycle proteomics dataset was conducted in R version 4.3.3. All R scripts used in this project are provided in Source_code_Dicty_proteomics.txt and in the accompanying PDF file. All input files and analysis outputs are located in the Dicty_proteomics folder. The analysis codes were adapted and extended from Edelbroek et al. (2024) [1,2].

Data

The raw proteomics dataset is available in the PRIDE database under the accession number PXD0620280.
